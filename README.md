# CS-Projects
Collection of some of my EPFL projects

Quiz App (April-July 2022): Conducted as a Bachelor Project and consists of a Quiz Application with the ability to create, modify and play a quiz with three question types: Multiple Choice, Text Input and Slider. Ran after installing the dependencies by running yarn start in the src folder's terminal.

Interactive Ball Game (April-May 2020): Collaborated with two university students to implement this Processing 3D game of a ball rolling on a mouse tilted platform with the possibility of adding new obstacles, viewing the game in multiple angles and continous score displays as well as my added animated confetti once the game boss Robotnik is defeated! The Game can be played by running the Game.pde file.

Gameboy interface (April-May 2020): Collaborated with a colleague to collectively simulate the behavior of the infamous Nintendo Gameboy allowing it to play game cartridges.

Jass Game (March-May 2019): Implemented the full well know Jass Card Game on Java with a fellow classmate that can be played by running the LocalMain class with four arguments consisting of at most 3 attributes each separated by a ":".
The first argument indicates the player type and is either "h" for human, "s" for simulated (which represents a simulated player that uses the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm to play) or "d" for distant. 
The second argument is optional and represents the Name of the player, if ignored the player will be assigned a default name. 
The third argument depends on the player type and is either the IP address of the remote computer for a distant player or the maximum number of iterations of the MCTS algorithm for a simulated player.
(Arguments are separated by a space).

Digit Recognition (October 2018): Worked solely on my first coding project (on Java) that recognizes digits from a test dataset by using the Machine Learning K-Nearest-Neighbors approach with the MNIST dataset as training data.

Alice in Wonderland Escape Game (February-June 2023): An Alice in Wonderland-themed virtual reality escape game designed alongside two EPFL students using C# on Unity. This game allows players to explore several unusual rooms, find clues to unlock doors, and complete puzzles in order to navigate their way into Wonderland.
